## Contributing to Algolia Samples

We built Algolia Samples for the community and we welcome any contributions.

There are different ways you can contribute:

### 1. Add functionalities or fix issues for existing samples

Every sample on Algolia Samples is open source and welcomes contributions.
Make sure to read the `README.md`, the `CONTRIBUTING.md` (if available) and eventual open issues before getting started.

### 2. Add your own sample

If you already have a sample or planning to build one, we will be happy to host and feature it on Algolia Samples.
Please follow the steps below to do so:

0. 🛠️ Start to build your sample (if you haven't already!)
1. 🤓 Take a look at our [coding guidelines](guidelines). We don't ask you to follow every point of them, but since those are followed for Algolia's samples, we think it's still important to offer a coherent experience.
2. 🖊️ Once your application is ready, [send it to us](https://www.algolia.com/developers/code-exchange/contribute/)
3. 💙 We will get back to you as soon as possible with any questions we might have or a way to publish your sample on Algolia Samples.
